# New optional section to define external registries to import in the current registry.
# Note: Unused imports will be detected by Weaver and reported as warnings by default.
imports:
  # Importing an external registry involves specifying the schema URL associated with that registry.
  # The current schema file structure needs to be updated, either by adding a reference to a
  # self-contained and fully resolved semantic convention or by directly integrating its content into the schema.
  # This approach is also well aligned with the OpenTelemetry Protocol specification,
  # which already specifies a schema URL at the resource and scope levels.
  - schema_url: https://opentelemetry.io/schemas/1.27.0
    # A short and local name used to reference signals and attributes from the imported registry.
    # We use `my_otel` here just to show that it can be any name and that different aliases can be used for the same
    # schema URL across different semconv files in the same registry.
    name: my_otel

  # Locally defined metric group can both extend a locally defined attribute group and
  # reference imported individual attributes.
